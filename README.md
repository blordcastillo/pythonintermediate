#Intermediate Geoprocessing with Python
The intermediate python course will pick up from the basic course with advanced techniques including cursors, string formatting, multi-threading, and regular expressions. We will take advantage of advanced tools such as virtualenv and utilize http communication. In the last hour, we will explore open source options for geoprocessing. You should understand the concepts covered in the basic class as a prerequisite to this class.
